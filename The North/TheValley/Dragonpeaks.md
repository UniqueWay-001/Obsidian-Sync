#North/TheValley 

### Overview
**The Dragonpeaks**  are a cluster of mountains in **The** **Valley** (See [[Description-The Valley]]). They all revolve around [[The Dragonpeak]] - The tallest mountain in the North. **The Drgonpeaks** are also known for their [[Dragons]]. **Dragons** being one of the deadliest creatures in the World, pose a serious threat to all the North. However, the peaks have turned into a frequented spot for explorers to venture, seeking to alure a dragon, and maybe even tame it like [[The Stories of old]]. 

The foothills of said mountains are covered with a dense jungle, comparable to those of the **South** (See [[Description of the Continent - The South]]). The jungles are fille with monsters- though the all flee before the dragons. The **Dragons** are much like the other ones found across **The North**,  particularly in **The [[Bay of Blood]]** and **The [[Green Bay]]**.
