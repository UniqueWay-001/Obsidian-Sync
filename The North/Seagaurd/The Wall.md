#Seagaurd
The Wall
The wall is one of the greatest achievements in all the North (See [[Description of the Continent]]). The monument stretches from The [[Ocean Waste]] to the [[Sapphire Sea]]. Over 50 feet tall and 20 feet wide the wall has kept Seagaurd out of almost all wars fought in the North. The wall is made of stone and has a concrete foundation. It has a 20 lookout bastions evenly spread from east to west. There are 3 gates in the wall which have become settlements of sorts, having inns, taverns, and even brothels.  The gates are open in the light except for times of war where all of them are shut.

### The Settlements are: 
	- [[The Eastpass]]:
		The largest of the gates, and the least fortified. a system of 3 doors hold the pass. 2 sets wooden doors followed by one of iron and steel.
	- [[The Center Pass]]:
		The most fortified and most prominent gates. Five sets of doors keep it. the merchants passing through these gates usually end up heading towards [[Wallhold]] and then beyond.
	- [[The Western Gate]]:
		The smallest of the gates and the one farthest from the cities it protects. This gate has been breached in the past but the collective strength of the Wall Keep have pushed back offence.
