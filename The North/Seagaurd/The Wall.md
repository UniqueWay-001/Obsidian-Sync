#Seagaurd
# The Wall:
The wall is one of the greatest achievements in all the North (See [[Description of the Continent]]). The monument stretches from The [[Ocean Waste]] to the [[Sapphire Sea]]. Over 50 feet tall and 20 feet wide the wall has kept Seagaurd out of almost all wars fought in the North. The wall is made of stone and has a concrete foundation. It has a 20 lookout bastions evenly spread from east to west. There are 3 gates in the wall which have become settlements of sorts, having inns, taverns, and even brothels.  The gates are open in the light except for times of war where all of them are shut.

### The Settlements are: 
[[The Eastpass]]:
	The largest of the gates, and the least fortified. a system of 3 doors hold the pass. 2 sets wooden doors followed by one of iron and steel.
[[The Center Pass]]:
	The most fortified and most prominent gates. Five sets of doors keep it. the merchants passing through these gates usually end up heading towards [[Wallhold]] and then beyond.
[[The Western Gate]]:
	The smallest of the gates and the one farthest from the cities it protects. This gate has been breached in the past but the collective strength of the Wall Keep have pushed back offence.

### The Wall Keep:
The wall keep are the watchers on the wall. They man the bastions on the wall and maintain it. Their numbers consist of Repairmen, Scouts, and Brutes. There hold patrols on both sides of the wall to seek for signs of damage and maintenance. The scouts are only trooped in times of war and alert the wall of armies inbound. The numbers of The Wall Keep have swelled drastically with the passage of time. Once a crew of 500 is now more than 5000. All the bastions are manned and every mile of wall has 30 men holding it.
