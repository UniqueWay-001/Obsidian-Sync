#North/Seagaurd 
# 🧱 Seagaurd – The Wall

### 📍 Overview

**The Wall** is one of the **greatest architectural feats** in all of the North (see [[Description of the Continent]]). Spanning from the raging tides of the **[[Ocean Waste]]** to the shimmering shores of the **[[Sapphire Sea]]**, this stone behemoth stretches unbroken across the northern frontier.

- **Dimensions**:
    
    - **Over 50 feet tall**
        
    - **20 feet wide**
        
    - **Concrete foundation + stone masonry**
        
- **Purpose**:
    
    - Originally constructed to keep **invaders and wild things** beyond the realm.
        
    - Over time, it has become **Seagaurd’s shield**—the reason it has remained untouched in nearly all northern wars.
