# Seagaurd – The Eastpass

### 📍 **Overview**

Of the three gates in **[[The Wall]]**, **The Eastpass** is the largest and most vital. With **three colossal gates**—two of **reinforced oak** and one of **forged steel**—it is often considered **impregnable**. These massive doors are flanked by towering ramparts and can only be opened **from the inside**, a feature both tactical and perilous in times of war.
