#Seagaurd 
Seahold if one of the most powerful holds in all of the North. It holds the strait of Sapphire- the entry into the [[Sapphire Sea]] and can blockade the [[Sapphire Isles]]. It houses the best naval power in the world only perhaps surpassed by [[Worlds End]]. It houses over 10,000 foot soldiers and has over a thousand warships. It collects heavy tolls on the ships passing the isles and providing the region with nearly half its coin. It is the most northern settlement of Seagaurd and is constantly visited by typhoons. 

It is the only non-commerce, settlement in seagaurd. 

Founded by **The shipwright** as legend tells, it was a kingdom of naval supremacy. Then it was conquered by Seagaurd. The seat in Seahold is that of the most powerful man in all of Seagaurd, even passed by the ruling regent. 

It holds the most influential choke in the North and can cut off all trade to the north. More trade passes through this lane than all the World.
