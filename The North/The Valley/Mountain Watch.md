# The Valley - The Mountain Watch
### 📍 Overview
**The Mountain Watch** was created out of the repeated invasions **The Valley** faced from the northwest. The fort is delved deep into the side of the mountain and has a mile wide boundary wall. The fort has been to defend **The Valley** until support from [[The Red City]] arrives.

### 🏰 Structure & Defense
The fort is dug deep into the mountains with only one way in/out. It has walls that are 100 feet high and guards for archers to shoot from. It sits in the **Basin of the gods**- a battle plain that can easily be defended. The narrowest part of the choke is 50 miles wide.

### ⛓️ Security & Stability
The [[Northern Pass]] has always been protected by the Mountain Watch and it is the strongest first line of defence.
