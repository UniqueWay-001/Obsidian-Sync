# 🧭 The North

### 🌍 Introduction

**The North** is one of the **great continents of the known world**—a realm of harsh borders, ancient legacies, and rising powers. It is a land shaped by **natural extremes** and **geopolitical tensions**, where the **winds howl over frozen walls**, and **dragon fire once seared the skies**. From the diamond-fueled engines of **[[Seagaurd]]**, to the cloaked peaks of the **Hidden Kingdom**, the North is a land of conflict, mystery, and power.
