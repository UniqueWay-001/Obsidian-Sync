#North/Seagaurd 
## ⚓ **Seagaurd – Seahold**

### 📍 **Overview**

**Seahold** is the **naval crown** of Seagaurd and arguably the **most powerful military hold** in the entire North. Situated at the mouth of the **[[Strait of Sapphire]]**, it commands total control over passage into the **[[Sapphire Sea]]**—and by extension, all northern sea trade. With **over 10,000 foot soldiers** and a fleet of **1,000+ warships**, Seahold is **the iron fist of the sea**, second only—perhaps—to **[[Worlds End]]**.
